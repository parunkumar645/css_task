      A good paragraph can be written if it is well-researched and has
      sufficient data related to the topic. The paragraph should have a good
      introduction sentence and a well-explained description regarding the topic
      and must end with a good concluding sentence that summarises the whole
      paragraph.
      <br />
      Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may
      say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than
      five or six sentences. But a good paragraph should not be measured in
      characters, words, or sentences. The true measure of your paragraphs
      should be ideas.
