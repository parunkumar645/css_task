    <h1>Paragraph</h1>

    <p>
      A good paragraph can be written if it is well-researched and has
      sufficient data related to the topic. The paragraph should have a good
      introduction sentence and a well-explained description regarding the topic
      and must end with a good concluding sentence that summarises the whole
      paragraph.
